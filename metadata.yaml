description: '"Thomas Troward (1847-1916) was an English author whose works influenced
  the New Thought Movement and mystic Christianity ... After his retirement from the
  judiciary in 1896, Troward set out to apply logic and a judicial weighing of evidence
  in the study of matters of cause and effect. The philosopher William James characterized
  Troward''s Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science as "far and away the ablest statement
  of philosophy I have met, beautiful in its sustained clearness of thought and style,
  a really classic statement." According to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) archivist Nell
  Wing, early AA members were strongly encouraged to read Thomas Troward''s Edinburgh
  Lectures on Mental Science. In the opening of the 2006 film The Secret (2006 film),
  introductory remarks credit Troward''s philosophy with inspiring the movie and its
  production."--Wikipedia June 2011.'
